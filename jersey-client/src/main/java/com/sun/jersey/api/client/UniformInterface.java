/**
 * A uniform interface for invoking HTTP requests.
 * <p>
 * Any Java type for a response entity, that is supported by the client
 * configuration of the client, may be declared using
 * <code>Class&lt;T&gt;</code> where <code>T</code> is the Java type, or
 * using {@link GenericType} where the generic parameter is the Java type.
 * <p>
 * Any Java type instance for a request entity, that is supported by the client
 * configuration of the client, can be passed. If generic information is
 * required then an instance of {@link javax.ws.rs.core.GenericEntity} may
 * be used.
 * <p>
 * A type of {@link ClientResponse} declared
 * for the response entity may be used to obtain the status, headers and
 * response entity.
 * <p>
 * If any type, other than {@link ClientResponse},
 * is declared and the response status is greater than or equal to 300 then a
 * {@link UniformInterfaceException} exception
 * will be thrown, from which the
 * {@link ClientResponse} instance can be
 * accessed.
 * <p>
 * In the following cases it is necessary to close the response, when response
 * processing has completed, to ensure that underlying resources are
 * correctly released.
 * <p>
 * If a response entity is declared of the type
 * {@link ClientResponse}
 * or of a type that is assignable to {@link java.io.Closeable}
 * (such as {@link java.io.InputStream}) then the response must be either:
 * 1) closed by invoking the method
 * {@link ClientResponse#close() } or
 * {@link java.io.Closeable#close}; or 2) all bytes of response entity must be
 * read.
 * <p>
 * If a {@link UniformInterfaceException} is
 * thrown then by default the response entity is automatically buffered and
 * the underlying resources are correctly released. See the following property
 * for more details:
 * {@link ClientConfig#PROPERTY_BUFFER_RESPONSE_ENTITY_ON_EXCEPTION}.
